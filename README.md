# Geog4/6300: Lab 6

Complete the lab assignment by filling in the template. Knit it to a Github document and then push it up to the Github repo for this assignment. When you're ready to submit, go to the "issues" tab and create a new issue. Use the subject line "Lab 6 complete" and then put "@jshannon75" and your name in the body, along with any other comments you want to share about the assignment. Your grade will be entered below:

* Question 1: This works--putting that `lapply` function to work!<p>
* Question 2: Nice job with formatting here<p>
* Question 3: Good<p>
* Question 4: Downside of the `lapply` here is that the results don't indicate which variable is included. Another option is to use `tidy` from the `broom` package to extract this information, which I think we've talked about briefly in class. Rather than referring to variable names, it's better to refer to the actual variables (Rainfall, not rain_20_sum). Also you don't address the magnitude of the coefficients here.<p>
* Question 5: Good<p>
* Question 6: Again, not answering all the items listed in the question--you need to talk about coefficient magnitude and also differences from Q4.<p>
* Question 7: Good<p>
* Question 8: Good<p>
* Question 9: Better if the text weren't in a code chunk. "Have an effect" is also vague--what kind of effect? Which seems most important?<p>
* Challenge:<p>
<p>
General feedback: Incomplete due to the need for more interpretation in Q4 and Q6.
